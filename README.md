## Description

As simple as it sounds. This React project works with the public [Reddit API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API) to serve as a simplified version where you can:

- See all the public content
- Go to the comment section of any post
- See a simplified version of any subreddit
- Search for any post or subreddit

As mentioned before this project is built using the React framework. For fetching the data with from API its uses the [Redux Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) feature included in the React Redux library.

All the website is styled with plain CSS separating them with CSS modules.

## Future Work

Currently, the public JSON Reddit API is being used for this project. Even so, Reddit also have another API that uses [OAuth](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), which offers a lot of more things we can do. Some of other ideas that can be implemented to the project are:

- Vote posts
- Comment
- See other users profiles
- See private content
- And much more
